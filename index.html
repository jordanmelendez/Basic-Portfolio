			<p> Jordan Melendez was born on the same day Wayne Gretzky became the first NHL player to reach 2,000 career points. That same season, the Chicago Bulls won their first of six NBA championships, coincidence? I'll let you decide. After 26 years of knowing Jordan, here are five things you should know about him if you want to remain on his good side:</p>
			<ol>
				<li> Don't bad mouth the Cubs if you are not prepared to backup what you're saying. 
				</li>
				<li> Don't bad mouth the Bulls if you are not prepared to backup what you're saying. </li>
				<li>Refrain from asking Jordan any questions about his personal life.<strong> FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.</strong> </li>
				<li> If it isn't Rap, Soul, Motown or Salsa, he doesn't want to hear it. </li>
				<li> When he's listening to Joe Rogan's Podcast <strong> DO NOT BOTHER HIM!!!</strong> The last person that did is playing spades with Harambe...allegdly. </li>
				<li> Remember numbers 1-5. </li>
